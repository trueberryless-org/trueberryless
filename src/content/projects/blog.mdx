## Project Overview

Writing has always been a passion by me. So sooner or later I was destined to create my own blog and since around INSERT YEAR it is available on https://blog.trueberryless.org. Give those posts a try, I promise you will likely enjoy reading some of them. Also, I try to make them visually appealing üòè

## Technical Challenges

While the basic blog setup was extremely easy thanks to the [Starlight Blog](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app) plugin for [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), there were some challenges along the way, especially with customizing the visuals and implementing quality-of-life features like the badges to GitHub profiles - if you want them too, I wrote a dedicated blog about how to create them üòâ: https://blog.trueberryless.org/blog/rehype-github-badge-links/

## Testimonial

<BlockQuote author="Maria Rodriguez, Beta Tester">
  This system has given me back my independence at home. The voice controls are so natural, and the haptic feedback
  helps me confirm every action without needing to see anything.

The project continues to evolve with regular content updates and technical features as well. One of the latest additions were the automated AI translations into German and French.
