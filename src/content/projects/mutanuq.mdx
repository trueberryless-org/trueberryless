## Project Overview

Already in the second year of my technical college I was enthusiastic about creating a website to organize my school notes. After many redesigns and relaunches, the project evolved to [Mutanuq](https://mutanuq.trueberryless.org). The website hosts most of my knowledge from the fourth and fifth year of college from all different kinds of subjects.

## Technical Challenges

The website is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) and inspired me to create many useful plugins for Starlight which I not only used in my personal project but shared with the awesome Astro community and the whole world. While writing the content and gathering the knowledge was a dedicated hard part sometimes, programming those features in my plugins was a technical challenge as well.

## Testimonial

<BlockQuote author="Maria Rodriguez, Beta Tester">
  This system has given me back my independence at home. The voice controls are so natural, and the haptic feedback
  helps me confirm every action without needing to see anything.

The project has been mostly inactive since I finished my degree. However, I regularly find myself looking up the knowledge I once knew by heart.
