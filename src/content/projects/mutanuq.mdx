## Project Overview

Already in the second year of my technical college I was enthusiastic about creating a website to organize my school notes. After many redesigns and relaunches, the project evolved to [Mutanuq](https://mutanuq.trueberryless.org). The website hosts most of my knowledge from the fourth and fifth year of college from all different kinds of subjects.

## Technical Challenges

The website is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) and inspired me to create many useful plugins for Starlight which I not only used in my personal project but shared with the awesome Astro community and the whole world. While writing the content and gathering the knowledge was a dedicated hard part sometimes, programming those features in my plugins was a technical challenge as well.

## Testimonial

<BlockQuote author="Anonymous Classmates from Felix">
  The website is fantastic. Even if I did not learn a lot for the exam, just reading through the content before the test, secures an average mark.

The project has been mostly inactive since I finished my degree. However, I regularly find myself looking up the knowledge I once knew by heart.
